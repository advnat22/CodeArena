⚔️ Code Arena

Compete. Solve. Dominate.

A real-time 1v1 competitive coding platform where two players battle head-to-head to solve algorithmic problems under time pressure. Built with a synchronized multiplayer architecture, backend code execution sandbox, and live winner locking.

🚀 Why Code Arena?

Most coding practice platforms are:

bloated 🧱
single-player only 🧍
slow to test locally ⏳
not built for real-time duels ⚔️

Code Arena focuses on:

⚡ real-time multiplayer
🧠 competitive pressure
🔒 server-authoritative judging
⏱ synchronized timers
🧼 clean distraction-free UI

✨ Features
⚔️ 1v1 Competitive Rooms

Private room codes

Creator-controlled match start

Live player presence tracking

Automatic winner locking

No race conditions

⏱ Real-Time Synchronized Timer

15-minute match duration

Server-authoritative start time

Client-side countdown synced to backend

Timer freezes instantly when winner is declared

Visual urgency indicator under 60 seconds

🧪 Backend Code Judge (Python Sandbox)

Secure server-side execution using child_process

Temporary isolated Python files

Automated test case validation

PASS / FAIL detection

Runtime error handling

Test-case specific failure feedback

Example failure output:

❌ Failed Test Case #1  
Expected: "fl"  
Your Output: "f"

📊 Instant Feedback System

Per-test-case error breakdown

No page refresh required

Unlimited submissions within time

Clear debugging visibility

🏆 Winner Declaration

First player to pass all test cases wins

Winner broadcast to both players instantly

Timer pauses automatically

Game locks after win

🧑‍💻 Clean Competitive UI

Dark mode coding interface

Focused editor layout

Real-time room status

Minimal distractions

Fast interactions

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

React (Vite)

React Router

Socket.io Client

Vanilla CSS (custom styling)

LocalStorage (username persistence)

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

Socket.io (real-time communication)

child_process (Python execution)

UUID (sandbox file isolation)

Code Execution

Python 3 runtime

Wrapped dynamic test runner

Controlled execution timeout

🔄 Real-Time Architecture
Client A  ↔  Socket.io  ↔  Node.js Server  ↔  Python Sandbox
Client B  ↔                ↔  State Maps


Server maintains:

room state

creator identity

start time

winner state

synchronized timers

Game state is queryable to prevent desynchronization on reload or navigation.

🧠 Design Philosophy

Server-authoritative state → prevents cheating and desync

Event + state hybrid model → reliable multiplayer behavior

Minimal UI → focus on problem-solving

No authentication (v1) → zero friction competitive access

Modular expansion-ready architecture

🏁 Current Gameplay Flow
